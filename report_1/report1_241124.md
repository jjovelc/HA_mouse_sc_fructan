# Mouse gut and spine single cell transcriptomics

## Report #1

### Background

Mice were fed with control diet or supplemented with B-fructan. Spinal cord and cecum tissues were dissected, enzymatically digested, FACS-sorted and finally subjected to 10X single-cell library construction.

Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq Illumina instrument at an average depth of 500,000,000 150-cycles paired-end reads per library. 

Metadata of libraries is included here:
